# NoahUI

Vue.js framework for web-artisans brought to you by [ArckInteractive](https://arckinteractive.com/).

NoahUi was conceptualized and brought to life by [Ismayil Khayredinov](https://github.com/hypejunction)

**This project is work in progress. Please abstain from using it in production environments until it reaches maturity**

We welcome contributions. Tests are incomplete and there are still some components that need work. We have started building out the framework with a number of big ideas and we weren't entirely sure, what would be possible, hence the framework underwent many iterations - tests would have kept us back, so we have incurred this technical debt consciously and will work on rolling in the tests as time allows. This started off as a passion project and we've been working on it in our free time. Given the extracurricular nature of it, please be gentle with criticism: constructive criticism is good, bashing is not acceptable.
