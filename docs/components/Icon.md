## Icons

<ComponentMeta name="NIcon" />

By default, NoahUI uses FontAwesome, which is imported from `styles/fonts.scss`.
You can import another icon font and use it accordingly.

In component docs, you will see all referenced icons, which you can replace by updating the
config value, when initializing NoahUI in your project.

<ComponentDemo name="Icons" />
